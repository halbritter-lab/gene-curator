# Gene Curator: Schema-Agnostic Curation Platform

## Vision Statement

Transform Gene Curator into a **methodology-agnostic** curation platform that supports any scientific approach to gene-disease association curation across clinical specialties. Whether using ClinGen SOP v11, GenCC based classification, institutional custom methods, or future methodologies not yet developed, the platform adapts through configurable schemas and scope-based workflows rather than hard-coded implementations.

## Core Philosophy

**Everything is configurable through schemas**: field definitions, validation rules, scoring algorithms, workflow states, and user interfaces. No methodology should be privileged or hard-coded into the system architecture.

**Scope-based organization**: All curation work is organized by clinical specialties ("scopes") such as kidney-genetics, cardio-genetics, neuro-genetics, enabling specialized teams to work within their domains while sharing the same flexible platform.

**Quality through 4-eyes principle**: Every curation requires independent review by a different curator before becoming active, ensuring scientific rigor and reducing errors.

## Current Problem

The existing system is **ClinGen-centric and workflow-limited**:

- Database schema assumes ClinGen verdicts (`Definitive`, `Strong`, etc.)
- Fixed scoring fields (`genetic_evidence_score`, `experimental_evidence_score`)  
- Hard-coded evidence categories and point systems
- Single workflow configuration without scope-based organization
- No multi-stage workflow with quality assurance
- ClinGen-specific UI components
- Inflexible to other curation methodologies
- No draft save/resume functionality
- Limited curator assignment and review workflows

## Proposed Solution

### Schema-Driven + Scope-Based Architecture

Every aspect of curation is driven by **versioned schema definitions** organized within **clinical scopes**:

1. **Field Definitions**: What data to collect for each methodology
2. **Validation Rules**: How to validate that data
3. **Scoring Algorithms**: How to compute verdicts/classifications
4. **Workflow States**: Multi-stage workflow with quality assurance
5. **UI Components**: How to render forms and displays
6. **Scope Organization**: Clinical specialty-based curation domains
7. **Review Workflows**: 4-eyes principle implementation
8. **Draft Management**: Save/resume functionality for work-in-progress

### Flexible Data Storage with Scope Management

Replace fixed database columns with **JSONB-based evidence storage** that adapts to any schema structure while supporting:
- Multiple precurations per gene-scope combination
- Multiple curations per gene-scope (one active, others archived)
- Draft state persistence with auto-save
- Complete audit trail with reviewer tracking

### Pluggable Scoring Engines

Support multiple scoring methodologies through a **registry of scoring engines** that can be selected based on schema configuration.

### Dynamic User Interface with Scope-Based Navigation

Generate forms, validation, and displays **dynamically from schema definitions** while providing:
- Scope selection and switching interface
- Multi-stage workflow navigation (precuration → curation → review)
- Draft save/resume functionality with auto-save
- Review assignment and approval workflows
- Active/archived curation management

## System Architecture

### 1. Schema Repository
```
curation_schemas → Store and version methodology definitions
workflow_pairs   → Combine precuration + curation schemas  
schema_selections → User/institution preferences
```

### 2. Scope-Based Curation Management
```
scopes        → Clinical specialties (kidney-genetics, cardio-genetics, etc.)
genes         → Gene entries with scope assignments
precurations  → Multiple precurations per gene-scope combination
curations     → Multiple curations per gene-scope (referencing precurations)
reviews       → 4-eyes principle review tracking
active_status → One active curation per gene-scope (others archived)
```

### 3. Flexible Evidence Storage
```
curations → Methodology-agnostic evidence storage (JSONB)
           → Schema-computed scores and verdicts  
           → Draft states with auto-save functionality
           → Complete audit trails with reviewer tracking
           → Scope-based organization and permissions
```

### 4. Pluggable Scoring
```
ScoringEngine(ABC) → Base interface for all methodologies
├── ClinGenEngine → SOP v11 implementation
├── GenCCEngine   → GenCC-based classification
└── CustomEngine  → Institution-specific logic
```

### 5. Dynamic Frontend with Workflow Management
```
DynamicForm → Renders any schema as a form
├── Schema-driven field components
├── Real-time validation
├── Live scoring updates
├── Multi-stage workflow navigation
├── Draft save/resume with auto-save
├── Review assignment interface
└── Active/archived curation management
```

## Workflow Architecture

### 5-Stage Scope-Based Workflow

```
1. Gene/Gene List Entry
   ├── Add genes with curation scope assignment (e.g., kidney-genetics)
   ├── Optional curator assignment
   └── Scope-based permissions and access control

2. Precuration Stage
   ├── Users select genes for precuration within their scopes
   ├── Multiple precurations possible per gene-scope combination
   ├── Draft save/resume functionality with auto-save
   └── Complete before proceeding to curation

3. Curation Stage  
   ├── Users select pre-curated genes for curation
   ├── Must reference an existing precuration
   ├── Multiple curations possible per gene-scope
   ├── Draft save/resume functionality
   └── Schema-driven evidence collection and scoring

4. Review Stage (4-Eyes Principle)
   ├── Different reviewer required (quality assurance)
   ├── Independent review of curation work
   ├── Approval/rejection with detailed feedback
   └── Mandatory before activation

5. Active Status Management
   ├── One active curation per gene-scope
   ├── New approved curations archive previous active ones
   ├── Manual override for active status changes
   └── Complete audit trail of status changes
```

### Data Relationships

```
Gene (1) ──→ (N) Precurations (scoped)
             │
             └──→ (N) Curations (scoped, require precuration)
                  │
                  └──→ (N) Reviews (4-eyes principle)
                       │
                       └──→ (0..1) Active Status (per scope)
```

## Conclusion

This architectural transformation positions Gene Curator as a universal platform for scope-based gene-disease curation that can adapt to any scientific methodology through configuration rather than code changes. The schema-driven approach combined with multi-stage workflow management ensures the system remains relevant and useful as scientific practices evolve, while maintaining the highest standards of quality through the 4-eyes principle.

The platform becomes truly methodology-agnostic and workflow-comprehensive: **as flexible as science itself, as rigorous as clinical practice demands**.
