# Gene Curator: Schema-Agnostic Architecture Implementation Plan

This directory contains the complete implementation plan for transforming Gene Curator into a flexible, methodology-agnostic curation platform that supports any scientific approach through configurable schemas.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Principle
**Everything configurable through schemas**: field definitions, validation rules, scoring algorithms, workflow states, and UI components. No curation methodology should be hard-coded into the system.

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Schema-Driven Design
- **Methodology Agnostic**: Support ClinGen, GenCC, custom institutional approaches
- **Version Control**: Full versioning of schema definitions and evolution
- **Plugin Architecture**: Scoring engines and UI components loaded dynamically
- **Configuration Over Code**: New methodologies via JSON, not software updates

#### 2. Flexible Data Architecture  
- **JSONB Evidence Storage**: Adapts to any schema structure automatically
- **Dynamic Validation**: Schema-driven rules engine
- **Computed Fields**: Real-time scoring and verdict calculation
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Immutable records with full provenance

#### 3. Universal Platform Design
- **Multi-Methodology**: Multiple approaches working simultaneously
- **Institution-Specific**: Customizable to organizational standards
- **Future-Proofing**: Accommodates methodologies not yet developed
- **Scientific Rigor**: Maintains data integrity across all approaches

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. JSONB Over Fixed Columns
**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL JSONB for evidence storage
**Rationale**: Maximum flexibility for unknown future methodologies
**Trade-off**: Some query complexity for infinite extensibility

### 2. Plugin-Based Scoring
**Decision**: Registry of scoring engines rather than inheritance hierarchy  
**Rationale**: Runtime selection and easy addition of new methodologies
**Trade-off**: Slightly more complex initial setup for maximum flexibility

### 3. Schema-First UI Generation
**Decision**: Generate forms dynamically from schema definitions
**Rationale**: Single UI codebase supports infinite methodologies
**Trade-off**: Less UI customization for universal compatibility

### 4. Clean Slate Migration
**Decision**: Fresh implementation without backward compatibility
**Rationale**: Remove all ClinGen-centric technical debt
**Trade-off**: One-time migration effort for long-term flexibility

## Integration Philosophy

The schema-agnostic architecture creates a **universal curation platform** where:

- **Scientists** can use any established methodology or create custom approaches
- **Institutions** can adapt the platform to their specific standards and requirements
- **Developers** can add new methodologies through configuration rather than coding
- **The Platform** remains relevant as scientific practices evolve and new methodologies emerge

This represents a fundamental shift from building a ClinGen tool to building **the platform that can support ClinGen and everything else**.

*This plan transforms Gene Curator from a methodology-specific tool into a universal platform for scientific curation that adapts to any approach through the power of schema-driven architecture.*
