    question: "What is Gene Curator?",
    answer: "Gene Curator is an advanced platform for genetic information curation and management, designed to support ClinGen Standard Operating Procedures v11 with automated evidence scoring and summary generation."
  },
  {
    question: "Who can use Gene Curator?",
    answer: "Gene Curator supports three user roles:<br/>• <strong>Viewers</strong>: Can browse and search gene information<br/>• <strong>Curators</strong>: Can add, edit, and manage gene data<br/>• <strong>Administrators</strong>: Full system access including user management"
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get access?",
    answer: "Contact your system administrator to request an account. New users are assigned the 'viewer' role by default and can be upgraded to curator or admin roles as needed."

  },
  {
    question: "How do I search for genes?",
    answer: "Use the search functionality on the Genes page to find genes by:<br/>• Gene symbol (approved, previous, or alias)<br/>• HGNC ID<br/>• Gene family<br/>• Chromosome location<br/>• Keywords in gene descriptions"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I import multiple genes at once?",
    answer: "Yes, curators and administrators can use the bulk import feature in Gene Administration to upload multiple genes from CSV files or paste data directly."
  },
  {
    question: "What data is stored for each gene?",
    answer: "Gene Curator stores comprehensive genetic information including:<br/>• Basic identifiers (HGNC ID, symbols)<br/>• Chromosomal location<br/>• Gene families and classifications<br/>• ClinGen scores and metrics<br/>• External database references<br/>• Change history and provenance"
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer: "Yes, Gene Curator implements multiple security measures:<br/>• JWT-based authentication<br/>• Role-based access control<br/>• Encrypted data transmission<br/>• Audit logs for all changes<br/>• Cryptographic content addressing for data integrity"
